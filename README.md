LED Token is a sport and health utility token (erc20) or "smart contract" written on the Ethereum Blockchain which focuses on rewarding users by following physical workout regimes and healthy plan schedules. Currently, we have a dAPP called "healthy habits" which locks in LED Tokens or Ethereum in a digital wallet and releases the funds at the end of the week after once the user completes and satisfies their weekly target plan. We are working on a 2nd dAPP that integrates with the Smartphone's Native Health app such as Apple Health and Samsung Health as well as smartwearables and import the health data into the blockchain and earn tokens for working out or focusing on preventative care and following a healthy lifestyle.


LED uses an interplanetary file system infrastructure built on a decentralized network on Amazon Web Services provisioned using Terraform, Ansible, Packer automation tools. There are multiple nodes to transmit electronic medical records (emr) as well as Python Applications using AI- Speech to text Chatbot/Virtual Assistant, NLP, Scikit, Numpy, Cloud computing, Facial recognition and dabbling with a fitness center in the Metaverse. 


We are developing real world solutions in the Sport & Health and Wellness industry to help people live healthier and reward them with health utility tokens that they can use in a health eco system for services or supplies. The users also own their health data which can be shared through a decentralized database on the Ethereum blockchain. The data is hashed with Ethereum's encryption for security and integrated using a web3.0 digital wallet as a vehicle mechanism to transport the data and owner's tokens.

Sport Leagues- Protect your assets, the players

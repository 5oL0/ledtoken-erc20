LED Token is a sport and health utility token (erc20) or "smart contract" written on the Ethereum Blockchain which focuses on rewarding patients and athletes by following regimes and workout plans. A decentralized application which integrates with the native smartphone's health app and smartwearables. 


LED also has an interplanetary file system for electronic medical records (emr) and Python Applications using AI- Speech to text Chatbot/Virtual Assistant, NLP, Scikit, Numpy, Cloud computing, Facial recognition and Crypto trading bots. 


We are developing real world solutions in the Sport & Health industry to protect the assets (Athletes/Players) and be able to share data and analytics to Coaches and Trainers in Sport leagues as well as Insurance companies who require the Patient's data. EHR records/data is hash encrypted in Ethereum's decentralized network for security and transferred via IPFS (interplanetary file system) on the Ethereum Blockchain using a web3.0 integrated wallet as a vehicle. Athletes and Patients can earn LED token rewards and accrue them to pay for health services within the LED eco system or convert tokens back to Ethereum.

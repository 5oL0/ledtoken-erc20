LED Token is a sport and health utility token (erc20) or "smart contract" written on the Ethereum Blockchain which focuses on rewarding patients and athletes by following physical workout regimes and healthy plans & schedules. There are two decentralized applications, one that integrates with the native smartphone's health app and smartwearable devices to track physical activities and mine tokens, the second one locks in LED Tokens on a digital wallet and is able to release the funds when the patient or athlete completes and satisfies their healthy habit.


LED uses an interplanetary file system infrastructure built on a decentralized network on AWS cloud provisioned using Terraform, Ansible, Packer running multiple nodes to transmit electronic medical records (emr) as well as Python Applications using AI- Speech to text Chatbot/Virtual Assistant, NLP, Scikit, Numpy, Cloud computing, Facial recognition in addition to Crypto trading bots.

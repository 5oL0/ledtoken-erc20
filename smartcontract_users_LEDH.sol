// ERC20 Smart contract for a token system that allows users to interact with their tokens and share their health data with various stakeholders:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract LEDH {
    mapping(address => uint) public balanceOf;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public allowed;
    mapping(address => bool) public healthData;

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint tokens);
    event Approval(address indexed tokenOwner, address indexed spender, bool approved);
    event DataShare(address indexed user, bool data);

    function approve(address spender, bool approve) public {
        require(msg.sender == address(this));
        allowed[msg.sender][spender] = approve;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, approve);
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint tokens) public {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= tokens && allowed[msg.sender][to]);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= tokens;
        balanceOf[to] += tokens;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, tokens);
    }

    function shareData(bool data) public {
        healthData[msg.sender] = data;
        emit DataShare(msg.sender, data);
    }
}

// This contract allows for the transfer of tokens between users, and also allows users to share their health data with other users. The balanceOf mapping keeps track of the number of tokens each user has, the allowed mapping keeps track of which users are approved to receive tokens from other users, and the healthData mapping keeps track of whether a user has shared their health data.
// Security and testing is still required
